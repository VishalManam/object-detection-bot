## Introduction

The Object Finder Bot is a Python-based application that utilizes Feature Matching and Detection Algorithms to locate a target object within a reference image. This powerful bot can assist users in identifying specific objects within complex images, making it a valuable tool for various applications such as computer vision, image analysis, and object recognition.

## Features

- User-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) built using Tkinter.
- Supports matching a target object against a reference image.
- Utilizes Feature Matching and Detection Algorithms for accurate object identification.
- Displays detailed results, including matched keypoints and bounding box around the target object.
- Provides options for adjusting algorithm parameters to fine-tune the matching process.
- Allows users to load custom target and reference images from their local storage.
